Currently taking a good look at Rust.

This project is just a joke.
None of the things you enter in the program will be saved anywhere except in the SQLite database "users_db.db"


Just found out about a problem with the program.
The final program crashes when you try to send your data.
I believe it's because it can't find the database.

What you have to do is to download the source code, and compile it yourself.
Or you can first change the database path to an absolute path on your PC and then compile the program.
